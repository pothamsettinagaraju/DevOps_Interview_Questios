AWS Lambda: Cost optimization
Lambda functions are Event driven, only it will trigger by event
It provide compute & Serverless Architecture

Advantages:
Compute
Serverless
managing auto scaling

Once the request is come aws will create server and once request done, it's automatically take down the server

Diff Between lambda and EC2

Lamda
We no need to think where it hosted and what is the IP address and autoscaling

EC2:
We need to handle IP address, Security, auto scaling etc

Lambda functions are Event driven and it can trigger by any event like CloudWatch any other, and it will perform a specific task which we assiged to lambda function.
it is written in python code.

We can simple say labmda is to perform some specific tasks or actions.
