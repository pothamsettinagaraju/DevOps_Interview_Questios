S3 can store any type of storage and accessible globally

1. Availability & Durability - its global service, we can access across the world.
2. Scalability - if our AZ is down even though we can access our S3 bucket because it can create multiple replica's accross the AZ
3. Secure - AWS provides security and access control to s3 objects
4. Cost effective - it has diffrent storage classes we can use that classes based on our usability.

Storage classes types:
We have multiple storage classes

1. S3 Standard - Access time 1-15 sec, cost $0.02
2. S3 Standard IA
3. One Zone IA - 3-5 min, $ 0.01 
4. S3 glacier  - Access time 12-48 hours, very less cost
5. S3 glacier instant retrieval
6. S3 glacier Flexible retrieval
7. S3 glacier deep archive - Access time 12-48 hours, very less cost
8. S3 outposts - high cost $0.03, access time varies
9. S3 Inteligent Tiering - access time 0.015- 0.025, access time varies

By using S3 we can achieve lot of features like:

1. we can enable versioning
2. we can create tag's - to identify which object is belong to which project
3. we can create access restrictions
4. we can enable encryption (by default aws provides encryption), if we want to do more encryption we can attach
5. Event notification
6. Object locking - if lock the object in S3 bucket no one can access or override the object
7. Amazon EventBridge
8.static web site hosting- we can access the s3 bucket object over the url
  for this static web hosting we have to disable block public access option in permissions and also we have to attach a policy we allow the users to access

policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid"  : "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "S3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::NameOfTheS3Bucket/"
      ]
    }
  ]
}


Sometime we may need to enable CORS: which will enable the multi website access to s3 buckets.
