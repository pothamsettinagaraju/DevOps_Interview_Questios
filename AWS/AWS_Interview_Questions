1.What is VPC and How it using in DevOps?
  A VPC is a Virtual Private Cloud by using which we would able to isolate our resources over a public cloud environment
  and by using this VPC I would be able to configure the CADR range for our particular VPC and i would be able to confiure
  the no.of subnets that i need to have and i would be able to confiure these according to the suites for our organization

2.What is Public Private Subnet and what are the differences between those two?
  By using a public subnet I would be able to host the resources which would be able to directly accessible from the public
  internet.
  By using Private subnet I would be able to host the instances which doesn't need to be accessed by the public internet directly
  and these would be typically the back end application server code or else the databases and the private subnet instances
  whould be able to downloads packages from the public internet directly by using NAK Gateway

3.How do you login to your private subnet instances?
  I would be using a bastion host in order to log to these private subnet instances and this bastion host would be residing
  inside the public subnet and we would be typically logging into the bastion host by using SSH and from the bastion host
  I would be logging into these private subnet instances by using the private IP

4.What will you do if you lose access to that private instance or lose the pem file?
  If i lost the access to EC2 instance right becasue of the pem file, I would be unmounting that particular voulme from that
  particular EC2 instance by stopping that instance and I would be attaching this particular voulme to anthor EC2 instance
  and I would be logging into that particular EC2 instance which i have the access to i will go to this particular directory
  and I would be modifying the authiorized keys and I would be modifying the .SSH authorized keys inside which i need to
  have the access too and i would be unmounting this particular voulme from the instance and i would be attaching it to the 
  older instance and i would be able to login by the new PEM file

5.Few LINUX commands used in your career?
  Multible commands which i would be using in day-to-day activities
  1. netstat -lntp  ->  in order to list the listening ports
  2. du -sh *  -> in order to check the usage
  3. lsblk  -> in order to list all the bloked devices
  4. ping  -> in order to test the connectivity
  5. telnet  -> in order to check the connectivity of a particular service in anther IP address
  6. htop top free -m  -> in order check the resouces of the EC2 instance
  7. ps -ef  -> in order to list all running  processers and i would be using | symbal in order to such particular process aswell
