1. Connect Ec2 Instance through terminal?
Ans: open terminal and goto pem folder which you downloaded while creating instance and run this cmd: $ ssh -i pemfile_name uname@publicIPaddress  EX: ssh -i aws_login.pem ubuntu@172.12.33.213
2. How to install Java on Ec2 instance?
Ans: connect Ec2 instance, run cmd: apt install openjdk-11-jdk
3. How install jenkins in Linux?
Ans: goto official website to install linux in unbuntu in my case: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
CMD:
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

VPC
4. What is VPC, How does it works?
Ans: VPC is a Virtual private cloud, where we would create resources over public cloud with private space.

Internet gateway -> Public Subnet -> Loadbalancer -> Routers -> Security group will check request for the port and IP address is coming from.

Elastic load balancer-> you have to attach private subnet and target group.

Automation you can define NACL to do same tasks mutiple times.

if we want to install or access internet via Private subnet we have to follow the NAT gateway to masking IP address otherwise our instance IP address will expose to outside world.

Changing IP adress by load balancer using SNAT gateway.
Changing IP address by using routers NAT gateway

SG -> only for allow
NACL -> allow + deny (can we attach to multiple instance in subnet)

If we open 8000 port in security group, if we block in NACL with 1st rule it will not be access.
if we open 8000 port in secuirty group, if we block in NACL with 2nd rule where as 1st rule allow all traffic then it will be access

5. Route53?
Ans: DNS as a service
Domain name service 
Domain Registration
|
-> Hosted Zones
route53 can do health checks aswell
Aws provide domain names and we can itegrate from outside if we purchased.

6. VPC Prod example?

copy a private instance pem file to bastion host:
scp -i /path_of_the_pem_file_in_local /path_of_the_pem_file_in_local ubuntu@publicIPaddreessof bastionHost:/home/ubuntu

7. What is IAM Users, groups, roles and policies?
Ans: Identify & Access management
IAM users - by using we would be able to authenticate and authorise the services in AWS
IAM groups - insted of giving all users to access, we can create a group for dev team and add the respected policies' and we can attach to that user.
IAM roles - we would like to give permission to application for accessing the any services, we can add roles to that application.
