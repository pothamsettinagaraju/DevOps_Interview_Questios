1. AWS CodeCommit
2. AWS CodeBuild
3. AWS CodePipeline - acts as a orchastrator which invokes code build and code deploy
4. AWS CodeDeploy

1. AWS CodeCommit: only private repos

Advantage:
Managed Git  -  it contain managed git
Scalability  - it will keep creating repositories
Reliability  - if we have any issues we can talk to AWS

Disadvantages:
Features
Aws restricted
Less Integrations with services outside AWS


2. AWS CodePipeline

AWS CodeCommit  -> Aws CodePipeline  -  AWS CodeDeploy  -> EC2 or Kubernetes
                        |
                    AWS CodeBuild

AWS END to END
AWS CodeBuild
goto -> code build -> create pipeline and attach source code  -> 

AWS Codepipeline
Manages entrire CI & CD process like azure-pipeline.yml file


Note:  We have to codebuild and codedeploy then we have integrate both with codepipeline
