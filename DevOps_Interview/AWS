1. What is ECS?
   Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a robust container orchestration service that facilitates the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications on AWS. With support for both EC2 and Fargate launch types. 
2. What is Lamda?
   AWS Lambda is a powerful serverless computing service that allows you to run code in response to events without managing infrastructure. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates with a broad range of AWS services. By focusing on code and not on server management, Lambda enables developers to build scalable, cost-effective applications with ease.
3. CDK vs CFN?
   Cloud Formation: might be preferable if you prefer working directly with declarative templates or have existing CloudFormation templates and infrastructure.
   CDK(Cloud Development Kit) : is advantageous if you prefer using programming languages, need complex infrastructure setups, or want to leverage the rich set of constructs and abstraction layers offered by CDK.
   Both tools are compatible and can be used in conjunction. For instance, you might use CDK to define complex infrastructure and CloudFormation for simpler, static setups.

4. How to integrate AWS ECS and Lambda?
   if you want to integrate ECS with lamda, first
   1. first you need to create ECS and define task definitions in ECS.
   2. seccond you need to create AWS Lambda which invoke the AWS ECS service using programming language
   3. Lambda fuction inoke the AWS ECS task or service based on your scope.
   4. AWS Lambda would trigger by AWS CloudWatch events or S3 or SNS.

4. What is EC2 and instance types?
    EC2 Instances Purchasing Options:
    * On-Demand Instances — short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
    * Reserved (| & 3 years)
    
    * Reserved Instances — long workloads
    + Convertible Reserved Instances — long workloads with flexible instances
    
    * Savings Plans (I & 3 years) —commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
    * Spot Instances — short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
    
    * Dedicated Hosts — book an entire physical server, control instance placement
    
    * Dedicated Instances — no other customers will share your hardware
    
    « Capacity Reservations — reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

5. what VPC?
   A VPC is a Virtual Private Cloud by using which we would able to isolate our resources over a public cloud environment
   and by using this VPC I would be able to configure the CADR range for our particular VPC and i would be able to confiure
   the no.of subnets that i need to have and i would be able to confiure these according to the suites for our organization

6. What is Public Private Subnet and what are the differences between those two?
  By using a public subnet I would be able to host the resources which would be able to directly accessible from the public
  internet.
  By using Private subnet I would be able to host the instances which doesn't need to be accessed by the public internet directly
  and these would be typically the back end application server code or else the databases and the private subnet instances
  whould be able to downloads packages from the public internet directly by using NAT Gateway(route table) or SNAT Gateway(Load balancer)

7. What is s3 and what are the storage classes of s3?
    S3 Standard: 
    Use Case: Frequently accessed data.
    Features: High durability, availability, and performance.
    Ideal For: Websites, content distribution, and big data analytics.

    S3 Intelligent-Tiering:    
    Use Case: Data with unpredictable access patterns.
    Features: Automatically moves data between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent) based on changing access patterns.
    Ideal For: Data with unknown or changing access patterns.

    S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access):    
    Use Case: Data that is less frequently accessed but requires rapid access when needed.
    Features: Lower cost than S3 Standard, with a retrieval fee.
    Ideal For: Long-term storage, backups, and disaster recovery.

    S3 One Zone-IA:    
    Use Case: Infrequently accessed data that does not require multiple availability zone resilience.
    Features: Lower cost than S3 Standard-IA, stored in a single availability zone.
    Ideal For: Non-critical data or data that can be recreated.

    S3 Glacier:    
    Use Case: Long-term archival data with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
    Features: Low cost for archival storage, retrieval fees based on access speed.
    Ideal For: Archival of data that is rarely accessed.

    S3 Glacier Deep Archive:    
    Use Case: Lowest-cost storage for data that is rarely accessed, with retrieval times of 12 hours or more.
    Features: Lowest storage cost, higher retrieval costs compared to S3 Glacier.
    Ideal For: Long-term archival of rarely accessed data.

    S3 Outposts:    
    Use Case: Data storage on-premises with AWS Outposts for use cases requiring local data processing.
    Features: Local data storage integrated with S3 on AWS Outposts hardware.
    Ideal For: Local workloads and data residency requirements.

8. Diff EC2 and S3?
   S3: Simple storage service, Scalable and store data.
   Purpose: bject storage service designed to store and retrieve large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, images, videos, and backups.

   EC2: Elastic Cloud Computing - it's virtual instance we can run our applications on EC2 instances.
   Purpose: Compute service that provides resizable virtual servers (instances) for running applications and workloads.

9. What is KMS?
   Key Management Service:
   Encryption: KMS can be used to encrypt data at rest in S3 buckets. You can specify KMS keys for server-side encryption (SSE-KMS) to protect the data stored in S3.
   By Using KMS can Encrypt: S3, EBS(Elastic Block store volumes), RDS (Relational Database Service), Amazon Redshift, DynamoDB, etc.

10. What is Amazon Redshift.
   Amazon Redshift is a powerful and scalable data warehousing service designed for large-scale data analysis and business intelligence. Its features, such as columnar storage, MPP architecture, and integration with the AWS ecosystem, make it a robust solution for handling large datasets and performing complex queries efficiently.


11. Egreess?
    Ingress refers to the incoming traffic or data entering your AWS resources from external sources, such as a user accessing a web application hosted on an EC2 instance.   
    Egress refers to the outgoing traffic or data leaving your AWS resources to external destinations, such as an EC2 instance sending data to the internet or another AWS service.

9. What if you deploy your application on EC2 instance you added load balancer and auto scaller, still your request is hung.
   Application Issues
   Infrastructure Misconfigurations
   Network Problems
   Instance Performance Issues
   Database or External Dependencies
   etc
10. What is AWS Cloud Watch?
    CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to collect, analyze, and act on metrics and log data from your AWS resources and applications.
