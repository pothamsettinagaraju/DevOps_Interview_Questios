1. How to delete logs older than 90 days
  find <search directory> -type f -mtime +x -delete
  find /apps/cipg/var/logs -type f -mtime +90 -delete
  Explanation: 
  find: The first option for the find command is the path to the search directory, if no path is passed it works on the present working directory.
  -type: The next component is the -type option. This option specifies what kind of object we are searching for. For example, f is used for all general file types such as text files, scripts, etc. The d type searches for directories only. Here we are looking for files only so, we use the f option with -type.
  mtime: The last component is the â€“mtime component which takes input the number of days, the searched object was last modified. In this case, we looking for files older than x days so, we passed +x, where the + suffix indicates that the time could be x or more but, not less.
  -delete: by using the inbuilt -delete option. This option deletes the files found by the find command. This is the most effective way to use the find command for deleting files as it uses a single command rather than multiple commands.
