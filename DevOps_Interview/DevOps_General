3. What is Monolithic and Microservice application?
  In monolithic architecture rt the entire application is entirely designed as a tightly coupled unit, and for suppose lets' say
  even if you want to make any modifications to a particular service rt, you should be deploying the entire application, and even 
  if you want to scale any of these services you should be deploying, you should be scalling the entire application as it's whole

  In the form of microservices rt we would be able to segregate this particular monolithic application into multiple individual
  microservices which are responsible for handling their own application code
  In the microservices rt we would be able to manage the scalling of the services efficiently why because we would be able to upscale
  or downscale a single service upon the usage of that particular service, and we will be using a Docker in order to containerize
  these mircroservices.

4. What is 3 tire Architecture?
