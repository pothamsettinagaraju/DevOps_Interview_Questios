1. What is OC?
   OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based container orchestration platform developed by Red Hat. It is designed to simplify the development, deployment, and management of containerized applications. OpenShift provides a comprehensive platform for managing containerized applications across various environments, including on-premises, public cloud, and hybrid cloud

2. Diff Kubernetes and OpenShift?
   1. Core Platform
   Kubernetes:
   What It Is: An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
   Components: Includes core components like the API server, controller manager, scheduler, kubelet, and etcd.
   
   OpenShift:
   What It Is: A Kubernetes-based container orchestration platform developed by Red Hat. It provides additional features and tools on top of Kubernetes to enhance developer and operational experiences.
   Components: Includes Kubernetes core components plus additional features like a developer console, integrated CI/CD, and enhanced security.
   
   
   2. User Interfaces
   Kubernetes:
   CLI: Primarily managed through the kubectl command-line interface.
   Dashboard: Kubernetes Dashboard is available for a web-based UI, but it's often seen as less feature-rich compared to OpenShiftâ€™s console.
   
   OpenShift:
   CLI: Uses the oc command-line tool, which extends kubectl with OpenShift-specific functionality.
   Web Console: Provides a comprehensive web-based console with features for managing applications, monitoring, and logging.
   
   4. Security
   Kubernetes: 
   RBAC: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing permissions.
   Security Contexts: Allows setting security policies for pods and containers.
   
   OpenShift:
   Enhanced Security: Adds Security Context Constraints (SCCs) for fine-grained control over container permissions.
   Integrated Security Features: Includes built-in security scanning and compliance tools.
   
   5. Storage and Networking
   Kubernetes:
   Storage: Supports various storage solutions through Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).
   Networking: Uses Kubernetes network plugins (CNI) for networking.
   
   OpenShift: 
   Storage: Extends Kubernetes storage capabilities with integrated solutions like OpenShift Container Storage (OCS).
   Networking: Includes an integrated software-defined networking solution (OpenShift SDN) and supports additional CNI plugins.
  
   6. CI/CD Integration
   Kubernetes: 
   CI/CD: Requires third-party tools and integrations for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD).
   
   OpenShift: 
   Built-In CI/CD: Comes with integrated CI/CD capabilities, including Jenkins pipelines, OpenShift Pipelines (based on Tekton), and a developer-friendly experience for building and deploying applications.
   
3. OC4 commands?
   CLI Uses 'oc' and rest all like Kubernetes commands
